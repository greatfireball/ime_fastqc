* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started)
* [OS X](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)
* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/)

## Usage

The docker image provides the [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) software. It will run the `fastqc` command as entrypoint.
Therefore, running a container is as easy as:

```
docker run --rm greatfireball/ime_fastqc --version
```

Just provide all required parameters via command line.
Default working directory is `/data`.
Therefore, input data should be mounted using `/data` volume.

Running the command to get the information for a local file `localfile` in the current folder:

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data greatfireball/ime_fastqc localfile
```
